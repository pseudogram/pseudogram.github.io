# Productivity is a Skill

## Endlessly chasing productivity
I have a slight obsession with productivity. Mostly because i'm not productive. To be productive you need to produce something. Productive comes from the latin root producier

I spent years chasing the idea of being more productive without really doing the research myself. Constantly chasing up-skilling opportunities without critically assessing what i *need* to improve upon. This is a story of my endless search for a tool an Excalibur, with the power of solving the problems my brain won't solve for me.

And I've come to realise its because I'm an addict. An instant gratification fiend. Incapable maintaining focus on a task for more than 10 minutes without letting my mind wonder to the eternal abyss of youtube and spotify. I often wondered what I would accomplish if I took control of my distractions. Would I live somewhere else? Would I be someone else? Would I be happier? Lol, no. And, yes. 

Alas, What you're here for "Productivitiy". Well truth is i think that procuctivity is the culmination of a number of skills and systems that can be worked on at any time, in no particular order. The key to the any productivity problem is perfect practice and attention to one skill at a time. There is no silver bullet. Build as you go, enjoy the process and eventually you'll get to where you neee to be.

> I'm realising as I write this that I like to add a lot of filler that is just noise in my head. At some point I'll improve and write more concise stories.

# Breaking it down
The first thing i've come to believe is that you need to build some base skills. Typing, and reading (to my detriment) are relatively slow. For years I've searched for tools to improve both of these skills and never really felt like I'd done so effectively.

you can only improve upon something you can measure. 

- Build a system you trust.
	- It's okay to forget anything.
- Don't consume mindlessly
	- This is my worst traite
- Skills
	- the productivity system
		- to do lists
		- calendars
		- notes
	- note-taking and organising
	- speed reading
	- touch typing
	- habit building
		- streaks
	- learn your keyboard shortcuts.
		- it really doesn't matter what app you're using. If you're on a computer, your life will be easier with keyboard shortcuts. Learn them.
		- My favourite apps are the ones that make keyboard shortcuts easy to learn. They usually have a "command pallet" `⌘ Cmd + k`, `⌘ Cmd + p` shows you a search bar that lists every command available to you, and you just need to practice the suggested keyboard shortcuts that you see when you need them.
